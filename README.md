Q.5: Using sufficient statistic to update mean, median, std. deviation of dataset
Q.6: Birthday Paradox

## Assignment 2
Q.1,2: Random vectors, transformation of random variables, CDF, PDF of X+Y etc.
Q.3: Proof of 1-sided Chebyshev ineq. using Markov ineq.
Q.4: Tail bounds on r.v. X using MGFs, and hence a tail bound on Bernoulli r.v.
